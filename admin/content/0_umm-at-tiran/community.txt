    On the morning of 11 November, armed
    settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost
    broke into the community and threatened
    two families. The settlers told the
    families they would kill them if they
    did not leave after 24 hours, in tactics
    mirroring the forced expulsion of
    neighbouring Khirbet Zanuta and Khirbet
    Ratheem. Witnesses said that the
    settlers held a gun to the head of a
    Palestinian woman. Later in the day, the
    settlers returned, including settlers
    from the Yehuda Farm outpost. They
    repeated the threat and set their dogs
    on the community’s flock of sheep and
    frightened the children, before leaving.
